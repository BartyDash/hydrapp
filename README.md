## Project Description

**Hydrapp** is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help users track their daily water consumption, promoting and maintaining proper hydration.

## Features

- **Adding glasses of water:** Users can add the number of glasses of water they drink to a daily counter.
- **Subtracting glasses of water:** If the user makes a mistake, it's okay , he can remove additional glasses.
- **Daily reset:** At the beginning of a new day, the counter is reset to count the glasses again.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- JavaScript
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - web bundler

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I gained experience in building my first PWA using Parcel and Tailwind. In addition, I practiced already learned technologies like localstorage, dynamic loading using JS and the previously mentioned Tailwind.

## Continued development

I am going to learn how to represent the data with a graph to give users the option to view the saved glasses each day.
